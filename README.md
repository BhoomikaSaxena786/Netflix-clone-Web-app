Netflix Clone: A Modern Web Application
Project Overview
This project is a single-file, desktop-first web application that replicates the core user interface and experience of the Netflix platform. Developed with a focus on clean, responsive design and modern development practices, it serves as a showcase of front-end skills using a combination of HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

Features
Hero Section: A dynamic, full-width hero image with an overlay and call-to-action buttons, showcasing a featured movie.

Responsive Navigation: A fixed navigation bar that adapts to screen sizes, providing easy access to key sections.

Content Rows: Horizontally scrollable content rows for "Trending Now" and "Top Rated" movies, mimicking the popular streaming service layout.

Interactive Elements: Buttons and content cards feature hover effects and smooth transitions to enhance user engagement.

Single-File Architecture: The entire application is contained within a single HTML file, making it easy to deploy and share.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the fundamental structure of the web page.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and consistent styling.

JavaScript: For handling user interactions and dynamic content.
