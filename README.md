Responsive Movie Streaming App
This project is a single-page, responsive movie streaming application designed to simulate a modern streaming platform's user experience. It serves as a comprehensive example of contemporary front-end development, showcasing a clean, component-based architecture built entirely with React and styled with a utility-first approach using Tailwind CSS. The application is a single, self-contained file, making it easy to deploy and share.

Key Features
Dynamic & Responsive UI: The application offers an intuitive and dynamic user interface with a fixed navigation sidebar for seamless browsing. The entire layout is built with responsiveness in mind, ensuring an optimal viewing experience on any device, from desktop to mobile.

Efficient Content Discovery: Users can explore a curated homepage showcasing featured and trending content. A built-in search functionality provides real-time filtering of the movie library by title and genre tags, allowing for quick and efficient content discovery.

Interactive Details Modal: Clicking on any movie card triggers a full-screen modal popup. This immersive component provides a detailed overview of the movie, including its description, year, runtime, and rating, without requiring a page refresh.

User-Centric Experience: A dedicated "My Netflix" section demonstrates state management by allowing users to track their watch history and manage a personal watchlist. The application also includes "Coming Soon" and "Downloads" sections to round out the user experience.

Technology Stack
React: The application's core logic is built with React, leveraging functional components and hooks (useState) for efficient and predictable state management.

Tailwind CSS: All styling is implemented with Tailwind CSS, enabling rapid development of a modern, consistent, and fully responsive design.

Lucide React: An icon library that provides a clean set of icons for the user interface, enhancing the overall professional aesthetic.

Future Enhancements
API Integration: Integrate with a movie database API (e.g., The Movie Database API) to fetch dynamic and up-to-date content.

User Authentication: Implement a full user authentication flow to allow for persistent user profiles, watchlists, and history.

Advanced Filtering: Add more advanced filtering and sorting options to enhance content discovery.

This project can be easily expanded upon to serve as the front end for a complete, production-level streaming service
